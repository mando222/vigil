# Chat-Driven Case Management

## Overview

The AI-OpenSOC chat interface now has powerful capabilities to automatically build out and manage cases based on natural language prompts. When you're examining findings and identify patterns that are part of a kill chain, you can simply tell the chat to add them to a case, and it will handle all the details automatically.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Automatic Case Building

When investigating, Claude can automatically:
- Add findings to cases
- Log activities and notes
- Build kill chain timelines
- Tag MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Document resolution steps
- Track all investigation actions

### 2. Natural Language Commands

You don't need to use specific syntax. Just describe what you want in natural language:

```
✓ "Add this to case-20260121-abc123"
✓ "This needs to go into case XYZ"
✓ "Create a case for this lateral movement campaign"
✓ "Note that this looks like T1021 lateral movement"
✓ "Log this as part of the kill chain"
✓ "Add these three findings to the APT case"
```

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Building a Case During Investigation

```
You: "Show me high severity findings from the last 24 hours"

Claude: [Lists findings f-001, f-002, f-003...]

You: "f-001 looks like initial access. Analyze it."

Claude: [Analyzes finding, determines it's T1078 - Valid Accounts]

You: "Create a case called 'APT Lateral Movement Campaign' and add this finding"

Claude: ✓ Created case case-20260121-abc123
        ✓ Added f-001 to case
        ✓ Tagged with T1078
        ✓ Logged activity: "Initial Access via compromised credentials"

You: "f-002 and f-003 look related - lateral movement via RDP. Add them to this case."

Claude: ✓ Added f-002 and f-003 to case-20260121-abc123
        ✓ Tagged with T1021.001 (RDP)
        ✓ Updated timeline with lateral movement phase
        ✓ Logged activity: "Lateral movement detected across 3 hosts"

You: "Note that the attacker moved from workstation-42 to server-15"

Claude: ✓ Added activity to case
        ✓ Added timeline entry documenting the lateral movement path
```

### Workflow 2: Creating a Case from Kill Chain Analysis

```
You: "I've identified an attack campaign. Initial access via phishing (f-101), 
      lateral movement through RDP (f-102, f-103), and data exfil to external IP (f-104).
      Create a case documenting this kill chain."

Claude: ✓ Created case case-20260121-xyz789 "Phishing to Exfiltration Campaign"
        ✓ Added 4 findings organized by kill chain stage
        ✓ Timeline created with 3 stages:
          - Initial Access (T1566 - Phishing)
          - Lateral Movement (T1021.001 - RDP)
          - Exfiltration (T1048.003 - Exfil Over Alternative Protocol)
        ✓ All MITRE techniques tagged
        ✓ Marked as HIGH priority
```

### Workflow 3: Ongoing Case Updates

```
You: "Add a note to case-20260121-abc123 that we've isolated the affected hosts"

Claude: ✓ Added activity to case-20260121-abc123
        ✓ Type: action_taken
        ✓ Description: "Isolated affected hosts from network"
        ✓ Logged at: 2026-01-21T15:30:00Z

You: "Add a resolution step - we blocked the C2 domain at the firewall"

Claude: ✓ Added resolution step to case-20260121-abc123
        ✓ Action: Blocked C2 domain evil.com at perimeter firewall
        ✓ Result: All outbound connections to C2 blocked
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Descriptive
When adding things to cases, provide context:
```
❌ "Add this to the case"
✓ "Add this finding to case-123 - it shows the attacker's persistence mechanism"
```

### 2. Build Timeline as You Investigate
Document events chronologically as you discover them:
```
✓ "Add a timeline entry - malware first seen at 2026-01-21 10:00 UTC"
✓ "Timeline entry: attacker moved laterally at 10:15 UTC"
✓ "Timeline entry: data exfiltration detected at 10:30 UTC"
```

### 3. Tag MITRE Techniques
Help build the full kill chain picture:
```
✓ "This is T1071.001 - tag it in the case"
✓ "Add T1059.001 and T1003.001 to the case - PowerShell and credential dumping"
```

### 4. Log Your Actions
Document what you've done:
```
✓ "Note that I've contacted the user whose account was compromised"
✓ "Log that I've isolated the affected systems"
✓ "Add a resolution step - installed security patches on all affected hosts"
```

### 5. Use Bulk Operations
When you identify multiple related findings:
```
✓ "Add findings f-101, f-102, f-103, f-104, and f-105 to this case - all show the same attack pattern"
```

## Integration with Investigation Workflow

The chat-driven case management integrates seamlessly with your investigation:

1. **Start Investigation**: Use chat to query findings, analyze patterns
2. **Identify Patterns**: Claude helps correlate findings and identify kill chains
3. **Build Case**: As you investigate, tell Claude to add findings to cases
4. **Document Analysis**: Your notes and observations are logged automatically
5. **Track Actions**: Resolution steps are documented as you take them
6. **Close Case**: Case has full timeline, findings, and resolution documented

## Example: Full Investigation Session

```
You: "Show me findings with lateral movement indicators"

Claude: [Shows 5 findings with T1021.* techniques]

You: "Get details on f-20260121-001"

Claude: [Shows RDP login from unusual source]

You: "This looks like the start of an attack. Create a case called 'Lateral Movement Investigation'"

Claude: ✓ Created case case-20260121-def456
        ✓ Added f-20260121-001
        ✓ Tagged with T1021.001

You: "Find similar findings using nearest neighbors"

Claude: [Shows 4 similar findings with RDP patterns]

You: "Add all of these to the case - they're part of the same campaign"

Claude: ✓ Added 4 findings to case-20260121-def456
        ✓ Updated activity log
        ✓ Added timeline entries for each event

You: "Analyze the source IPs - are they malicious?"

Claude: [Uses threat intel tools to analyze IPs]
        ✓ IP 192.168.50.10 appears compromised
        ✓ IP 192.168.50.15 shows suspicious activity
        ✓ Logged analysis in case activities

You: "I've isolated those two systems. Log that as a resolution step."

Claude: ✓ Added resolution step to case
        ✓ Action: Isolated systems 192.168.50.10 and 192.168.50.15
        ✓ Result: Systems removed from network, investigation continuing

You: "Update case status to 'investigating' and assign to me"

Claude: ✓ Updated case-20260121-def456
        ✓ Status: investigating
        ✓ Assigned to: [your username]
```

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Natural Language Processing**: Claude interprets your intent from natural language
2. **Context Awareness**: Claude tracks which finding/case you're examining
3. **Automatic Tool Selection**: Claude picks the right MCP tool for your request
4. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple operations happen simultaneously when possible
5. **Confirmation**: Claude confirms what was done and shows the results

### MCP Tool Architecture

### Extending the System

You can add more case management tools by:

1. Adding new functions to `tools/deeptempo_findings.py`
2. Using the `@mcp.tool()` decorator
3. Following the existing patterns for error handling and JSON responses
4. Restarting the MCP server to load new tools

## Troubleshooting

### "Case not found"
- Verify the case ID format: `case-YYYYMMDD-xxxxxxxx`
- Use `list_cases()` to see available cases

### "Finding not found"  
- Verify the finding ID format: `f-YYYYMMDD-xxxxxxxx`
- Use `list_findings()` to see available findings

### Changes not appearing
- Refresh the UI
- Check the case via `get_case(case_id)` to verify changes

### Tools not available
- Ensure MCP server is running: check `mcp-config.json`
- Verify `tools/deeptempo_findings.py` is accessible
- Restart backend services if needed

## Security & Audit Trail

All case modifications are:
- Timestamped with ISO 8601 format
- Logged in the database
- Trackable through case activities
- Reversible (findings can be removed, etc.)

Every action Claude takes on cases is recorded, providing a full audit trail of AI-assisted investigation.

## Summary

The chat-driven case management feature transforms how you investigate security incidents. Instead of manually creating cases, adding findings, and documenting your work, you can have a natural conversation with Claude and it will:

✓ Automatically add findings to cases
✓ Build kill chain timelines
✓ Tag MITRE techniques  
✓ Log all your investigation activities
✓ Document resolution steps
✓ Track the full investigation narrative

**Just investigate naturally and tell Claude what you're finding. It handles the rest.**
