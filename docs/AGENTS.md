# SOC AI Agents

12 specialized AI agents for different security operations tasks.

## Tool Access

All agents have access to tools through two integration methods:

### Agent SDK (Recommended - Web UI)
- **19 Backend Tools** via Claude API function calling
- Security detections, case management, approvals, MITRE ATT&CK
- **Zero desktop dependency** - Works entirely through the API
- Production-ready for multi-user deployments
- Enabled by default in web UI

### MCP Tools (Optional - Advanced Use)
- **100+ Extended Tools** for specialized integrations
- Requires additional MCP server configuration
- Best for advanced local workflows or specialized integrations

> **Default Behavior**: Agents automatically use backend tools via Agent SDK in the web UI with no additional configuration needed.

| Auto-Responder | Balanced | Yes | Autonomous actions |

## Skills (Workflows)

These workflows are formalized as **Skills** -- executable multi-agent playbooks in the [`/skills/`](/skills/) directory. Each skill has a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter metadata and detailed phase-by-phase instructions.

Skills can be executed from the **Skills** page in the UI or via the `/api/skills/{id}/execute` API endpoint.

| Skill | Agents | Use Case | Skill File |
|-------|--------|----------|------------|
| **Incident Response** | Triage -> Investigator -> Responder -> Reporter | Active incident handling | [`skills/incident-response/SKILL.md`](/skills/incident-response/SKILL.md) |
| **Full Investigation** | Investigator -> MITRE Analyst -> Correlator -> Responder -> Reporter | Deep-dive analysis with ATT&CK mapping | [`skills/full-investigation/SKILL.md`](/skills/full-investigation/SKILL.md) |
| **Threat Hunt** | Threat Hunter -> Network Analyst -> Malware Analyst -> Threat Intel -> Reporter | Proactive hypothesis-driven hunting | [`skills/threat-hunt/SKILL.md`](/skills/threat-hunt/SKILL.md) |
| **Forensic Analysis** | Forensics -> Malware Analyst -> Network Analyst -> Reporter | Post-incident forensics with chain of custody | [`skills/forensic-analysis/SKILL.md`](/skills/forensic-analysis/SKILL.md) |

### Adding Custom Skills

Create a new directory under `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skills/
  my-custom-workflow/
    SKILL.md    # YAML frontmatter + markdown workflow definition
```

The backend discovers skills automatically on startup. Use `POST /api/skills/reload` to pick up changes without restart.

| 0.70-0.84 | Requires manual approval |
| < 0.70 | Monitor only |

## Backend Tools by Agent (Agent SDK)

All agents use these tools via Claude API function calling:

| Agent | Primary Backend Tools |
|-------|----------------------|
| Triage | `list_findings`, `get_finding`, `create_case` |
| Investigator | All backend tools, `nearest_neighbors`, detection search |
| Threat Hunter | `nearest_neighbors`, detection search, pattern intelligence |
| Correlator | `nearest_neighbors`, `technique_rollup`, `attack_layer` |
| Responder | `create_approval_action`, `list_approval_actions`, template generation |
| Reporter | `create_attack_layer`, case export |
| MITRE Analyst | `technique_rollup`, `get_findings_by_technique`, coverage analysis, gap identification |

See [DETECTION_ENGINEERING.md](DETECTION_ENGINEERING.md) for detailed tool descriptions and workflows.

## Usage Tips

1. **Match agent to task** - Use the specialist for your need
2. **Switch freely** - Change agents mid-conversation
3. **Start with Triage** - When unsure where to begin
4. **End with Reporter** - Document findings
5. **Use thinking agents** - For complex analysis (Investigator, Hunter, Forensics)
6. **Use fast agents** - For quick decisions (Triage, Responder)
