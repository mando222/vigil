## Quick Start

### Installation

Detection repositories are automatically cloned during `./setup_dev.sh`:

```bash
./setup_dev.sh
# Automatically clones ~4GB of detection repositories to ~/security-detections/
```

To skip automatic installation:
```bash
SKIP_DETECTION_REPOS=true ./setup_dev.sh
```

To update existing repositories:
```bash
./scripts/setup_detection_repos.sh --update
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
python scripts/test_detection_integration.py
```

This verifies:
- ✅ All 4 detection repositories cloned
- ✅ ~7,200+ rules indexed
- ✅ MCP server configured
- ✅ Environment variables set

## Tool Categories

### 1. Coverage Analysis (6 tools)

Quantify your detection coverage across MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

| Tool | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `analyze_coverage` | Check coverage for specific techniques | `analyze_coverage(techniques=["T1059.001", "T1071.001"])` |
| `identify_gaps` | Find missing detections for threat/campaign | `identify_gaps(context="ransomware")` |
| `get_coverage_stats` | Overall statistics by format | `get_coverage_stats(source_type="splunk")` |
| `get_technique_coverage` | Coverage for single technique | `get_technique_coverage("T1486")` |
| `compare_coverage` | Compare across formats | `compare_coverage(techniques=["T1059.001"])` |

**Example Workflow:**
```
1. Investigate incident → Identify techniques: T1071.001, T1573.001, T1486
2. analyze_coverage(["T1071.001", "T1573.001", "T1486"])
3. Result: 85% coverage - T1486 has weak coverage
4. identify_gaps("ransomware") → Strategic view of all gaps
5. Prioritize T1486 for new detection development
```

### 2. Detection Search (12 tools)

Find relevant detection rules:

New detections flow through approval:
```
1. Generate template → det_456
2. Create approval action:
   - Action: Deploy detection det_456
   - Confidence: 0.85 (requires approval)
   - Reasoning: Addresses T1486 gap
3. Analyst reviews and approves
4. Auto-deploy to Splunk/Elastic
```

### MITRE ATT&CK Integration

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Ransomware Coverage Assessment

```
You: "Switch to MITRE Analyst agent"
Claude: [Switches to MITRE Analyst]

You: "Analyze our detection coverage for ransomware attacks"
Claude: [Uses identify_gaps("ransomware")]
        "Gap analysis shows weak coverage for:
         - T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact): 2 detections
         - T1490 (Inhibit System Recovery): 1 detection
         - T1489 (Service Stop): 0 detections
         
         Recommendation: Prioritize T1486 and T1490"

You: "Generate a Splunk detection for T1486"
Claude: [Uses generate_template("T1486", "splunk", "Sysmon")]
        "Here's a template detecting rapid file encryption..."

You: "Add this to case-2026-ransomware"
Claude: [Creates approval action, links to case]
        "Detection submitted for approval and linked to case"
```

### Workflow 2: APT Threat Emulation

```
You: "Run apt-threat-emulation for APT29"
Claude: [Uses expert prompt + mitre-attack-mcp]
        "APT29 Analysis:
         
         Techniques Used: 15
         - T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment)
         - T1059.001 (PowerShell)
         - T1071.001 (Web Protocols)
         ...
         
         Coverage: 67% (10/15 techniques)
         
         Gaps:
         - T1027.005 (Indicator Removal)
         - T1552.001 (Credentials in Files)
         ...
         
         Purple Team Plan:
         1. Test T1566.001 with sample phish
         2. Execute PowerShell techniques
         3. Validate C2 detections
         ..."
```

### Workflow 3: Detection Tuning

```
You: "Switch to Threat Hunter agent"
Claude: [Switches to Threat Hunter]

You: "What patterns exist for detecting C2 beaconing?"
Claude: [Uses extract_patterns("T1071.001")]
        "Analyzed 127 C2 detection rules. Common patterns:
         
         1. Regular beaconing intervals (60s, 300s, 3600s)
         2. Small payload sizes (< 1KB)
         3. HTTPS to non-standard ports
         4. User-Agent anomalies
         5. Base64-encoded payloads
         
         Field mappings:
         - Splunk: dest_port, http_method, bytes_out
         - Elastic: destination.port, http.request.method
         - KQL: DestinationPort, RequestMethod"

You: "Create a hunt hypothesis using these patterns"
Claude: "Hunt for hosts with:
         - Outbound HTTPS every ~300 seconds
         - Consistent payload size < 500 bytes
         - Non-browser User-Agents
         - To suspicious ASNs"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Detection Repositories Not Found

```bash
# Check if repositories exist
ls -l ~/security-detections/

# Re-clone repositories
rm -rf ~/security-detections/
./scripts/setup_detection_repos.sh
```

### MCP Server Not Loading

```bash
# Verify configuration
cat mcp-config.json | grep security-detections

# Test MCP server standalone
npx security-detections-mcp

# Check environment variables
echo $SIGMA_PATHS
```

### Low Detection Count

```bash
# Verify repository contents
find ~/security-detections/sigma/rules -name "*.yml" | wc -l
find ~/security-detections/security_content/detections -name "*.yml" | wc -l

# Should show thousands of files
```

### Tools Not Loading

1. Restart the backend server (`uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`)
2. Check MCP server status via API: `GET /api/mcp/servers/status`
3. Verify configuration with test script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_detection_integration.py
   ```

## Best Practices

### 1. Document Decisions

Always log why you prioritized certain detections:
```python
log_decision(
    context="Incident response for case-123",
    decision="Prioritized T1486 detection",
    reasoning="Identified as gap during ransomware investigation",
    tags=["ransomware", "priority", "incident-driven"]
)
```

### 2. Use Pattern Intelligence

Don't start from scratch - learn from existing rules:
```python
# Before creating detection
patterns = extract_patterns("T1059.001")
fields = learn_field_usage("T1059.001")

# Use patterns to inform your detection
```

### 3. Validate Before Deploying

Always validate generated templates:
```python
# Generate template
template = generate_template("T1486", "splunk")

# Validate syntax
result = validate_detection(template, format="splunk")

# Submit for approval
create_approval_action(
    action="deploy_detection",
    confidence=0.85,
    reasoning="Validated template for T1486 gap"
)
```

### 4. Regular Coverage Reviews

Schedule quarterly reviews:
```python
# Q1 2026 Review
coverage = get_coverage_stats()
gaps = identify_gaps(context="Q1-2026-priorities")
report = generate_gap_report(format="pdf")

# Document review
log_decision(
    context="Q1 2026 Coverage Review",
    decision="Prioritize initial access techniques",
    reasoning="Coverage analysis shows 45% gap in initial access"
)
```

### 5. Cross-Reference with Incidents

Link detections to actual incidents:
```python
# After incident investigation
create_entity("Incident-2026-001", "incident")
link_detection_to_entity("det_456", "Incident-2026-001", "would_detect")

# Future benefit: "What detections cover similar incidents?"
```

## Performance Considerations

### Repository Size

Detection repositories total ~4GB:
- Sigma: ~1.5GB
- Splunk ESCU: ~1GB
- Elastic: ~800MB
- KQL: ~700MB

Use `--depth 1` for shallow clones (done automatically).

### Indexing Time

First load indexes 7,200+ rules:
- Initial index: 30-60 seconds
- Subsequent queries: < 1 second
- Pattern extraction: 2-5 seconds per technique

### Disk Usage

Monitor disk usage:
```bash
du -sh ~/security-detections/
```

Clean old checkouts if needed:
```bash
cd ~/security-detections/
git gc --aggressive --prune=all
```
