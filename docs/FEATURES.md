# Features

## Case Management

Full investigation lifecycle tracking.

### Case Tabs

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| Overview | Status, priority, assignee, timeline |
| Findings | Associated security findings |
| Activities | Audit trail of actions |
| Resolution | Step-by-step resolution documentation |

### Case Status Flow

```
Open -> In Progress -> Resolved -> Closed
```

### Resolution Steps

Document each resolution step with:
1. **Description**: What was done
2. **Action Taken**: Detailed explanation
3. **Result**: Outcome
4. **Timestamp**: Auto-recorded

### PDF Reports

Generate professional case reports with full timeline, findings, and resolution steps.

## Approval Workflow

Human-in-the-loop for autonomous actions.

### Confidence Thresholds

| Confidence | Normal Mode | Force Manual Mode |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| >= 0.90 | Auto-approved | Requires approval |
| 0.85-0.89 | Auto-approved + flag | Requires approval |
| 0.70-0.84 | Requires approval | Requires approval |
| < 0.70 | Monitor only | Monitor only |

### Force Manual Approval

Enable via **Dashboard > Approval Queue** checkbox.

Use when:
- Training/testing environment
- During active incidents
- New deployment (first weeks)
- Compliance requirements

### Action Types

- `isolate_host` - Network isolate compromised host
- `block_ip` - Block malicious IP
- `block_domain` - Block malicious domain
- `quarantine_file` - Quarantine malicious file
- `disable_user` - Disable compromised account
- `execute_spl_query` - Run Splunk query
- `custom` - Custom action

## AI Finding Enrichment

Automatic AI analysis cached on first view.

### Enrichment Contents

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Threat Summary | Clear overview of the threat |
| Threat Type | Classification (exfiltration, lateral movement, etc.) |
| Risk Level | Critical, High, Medium, Low |
| Potential Impact | Business impact explanation |
| Recommended Actions | Prioritized response steps |
| Investigation Questions | Key questions for deeper analysis |
| Related Techniques | MITRE ATT&CK mapping |
| Indicators of Compromise | Malicious IPs, domains, processes |
| Confidence Score | AI's confidence (0-100%) |

### Usage

1. Open any finding detail view
2. Enrichment auto-generates on first view
3. Cached in database for instant retrieval
4. Optional: Force regeneration button

## Autonomous Response

Auto-Responder agent for automated containment.

### Multi-Source Correlation

1. Pull alerts from Tempo Flow (network)
2. Pull alerts from CrowdStrike (endpoint)
3. Correlate by IP, time, behavior
4. Calculate confidence score
5. Take action based on threshold

### Confidence Calculation

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Multiple corroborating alerts | +0.20 |
| Critical severity | +0.15 |
| Lateral movement | +0.15 |
| Ransomware behavior | +0.25 |
| Time correlation | +0.10 |

### Example Flow

```
1. Detect suspicious IP
2. Query Tempo Flow -> Lateral movement detected
3. Query CrowdStrike -> Ransomware behavior
4. Calculate confidence: 0.85
5. Auto-isolate host (threshold met)
6. Report to analyst
```

## MITRE ATT&CK Integration

### Attack Layer Visualization

- View technique coverage
- Color-coded by severity/confidence
- Export to ATT&CK Navigator format

### Technique Rollup

- Count findings per technique
- Sort by prevalence
- Filter by time window

### MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_attack_layer` | Current layer visualization |
| `get_technique_rollup` | Technique statistics |
| `get_findings_by_technique` | Findings for specific TID |
| `get_tactics_summary` | Tactic summary |
| `create_attack_layer` | Generate new layer |

## Chat Interface
